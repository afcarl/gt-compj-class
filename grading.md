# Grading #

Assessment will have the following components:

- Three **assignments**, 10% each = 30%. See T-square for deadlines.
- **Reading comprehension**, measured through reading reviews and pop quizzes: 10%. Six assessments, 2% each, you get credit for your best five.
- **Class participation**: 10%
- Written & oral **critique** of a computational journalism artifact: 10%
- **Final project**: 25%. This includes pre-proposal (2%), proposal (3%), presentation (5%), writeup (10%), self-assessment (2%), and feedback on other students' projects (3%).
- **Twitter**: 15%
  - 5% for creating a class Twitter feed (see T-square for details)
  - 1% per week for tweeting a link relevant to the reading, max of 10% for the semester

Each component will be described in detail on T-square. Cutoffs for A/B/C and 90/80/70. If you are taking the course "pass/fail", a grade of "C" is required to pass.

# Policies #

(Partly copied from [last year's course](https://compjournalism.wordpress.com/sp2014/))

- In-class discussion is a major part of learning and assessment in this course, so attendance is required. Late by 15 minutes, counts as an absence. Legitimate reasons for being excused from class include: personal issues, health (keep those germs away from class), interview, conference travel, etc. Travelling and exploring, assignments due in other classes, out to pick up friends, and other such excuses not accepted. Please inform Instructor of a planned absence via this [form](http://goo.gl/forms/mwf2JQXpc4) **before class**.
- Respect your classmates and your instructor by avoiding distractions. This means be there on time, turn off your cellphone, and save side conversations for after class.
- Multiple studies have shown that using a laptop in class -- even for taking notes -- reduces students' educational attainment. See [here](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/06/the-case-for-banning-laptops-in-the-classroom.html) for a popular press article summarizing this research. You are adults and must make your own decision, but my advice is to try pen and paper instead. We will occasionally have in-class demos and coding exercises, in which case you will want to bring a laptop. Advance notice will be given.
- This class abides by the Georgia Tech Honor Code. All assigned work is expected to be individual, except where explicitly written otherwise. You are encouraged to discuss the assignments with your classmates; however, what you hand in should be your own work. If any work product was produced based on discussions with someone else (in the class OR outside), please specify clearly in the final turn-in.
